# Elements

## Doctype
{{ organization }} makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. Include it at the beginning of all your projects.

### HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

## Units &amp; Measurement

CSS3 introduces a few new units, including the rem unit, which stands for "root em". The em unit is relative to the font-size of the parent, which causes the compounding issue. The rem unit is relative to the root—or the html—element. That means that we can define a single font size on the html element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.

### HTML
```html
html { font-size: 62.5%; } 
body { font-size: 14px; font-size: 1.4rem; } /* =14px */
h1   { font-size: 24px; font-size: 2.4rem; } /* =24px */
```

## Typography

### Neue Haas Grotesk

The digital version of Helvetica that everyone knows and uses today is quite different from the typeface’s pre-digital
design. Originally released as Neue Haas Grotesk, many of the features that made it a Modernist favorite were lost in
translation as the designs were reworked for changing typesetting technologies.

In 2011, type designer Christian Schwartz restored the original Neue Haas Grotesk in digital form – bringing back features like optical size variations, alternate glyphs, and refined spacing – and captured much of the warmth and personality of the original.

Neue Haas Grotesk is the most widely used font on the MIT Technology Review website. It's used for body text, metadata, story lists and streams, comments, and other widgets.

### Miller

Miller, designed by Matthew Carter in 1997, is a “Scotch Roman,” a class of sturdy, general purpose types of Scottish
origin, widely used in the United States in the 19th century. 

Miller is faithful to the Scotch style though not to any one historical example — and is authentic in having both roman and italic
small caps, a feature of the originals.

On our website, we use Miller almost exclusively for headlines on article pages.

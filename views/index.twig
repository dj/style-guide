# Elements

## Doctype
{{ organization }} makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. Include it at the beginning of all your projects.

### HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

## Units &amp; Measurement

CSS3 introduces a few new units, including the rem unit, which stands for "root em". The em unit is relative to the font-size of the parent, which causes the compounding issue. The rem unit is relative to the root—or the html—element. That means that we can define a single font size on the html element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.

### HTML
```html
html { font-size: 62.5%; } 
body { font-size: 14px; font-size: 1.4rem; } /* =14px */
h1   { font-size: 24px; font-size: 2.4rem; } /* =24px */
```

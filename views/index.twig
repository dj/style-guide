# Elements
Fundamental building blocks of MIT Technology Review's digital styles.

## Doctype
{{ organization }} makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. Include it at the beginning of all your projects.

### HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

## Units &amp; Measurement

CSS3 introduces a few new units, including the rem unit, which stands for "root em". The em unit is relative to the font-size of the parent, which causes the compounding issue. The rem unit is relative to the root—or the html—element. That means that we can define a single font size on the html element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.

### HTML
```html
html { font-size: 62.5%; } 
body { font-size: 14px; font-size: 1.4rem; } /* =14px */
h1   { font-size: 24px; font-size: 2.4rem; } /* =24px */
```

## Typography

#### Fonts

### Neue Haas Grotesk

The digital version of Helvetica that everyone knows and uses today is quite different from the typeface’s pre-digital
design. Originally released as Neue Haas Grotesk, many of the features that made it a Modernist favorite were lost in
translation as the designs were reworked for changing typesetting technologies.

In 2011, type designer Christian Schwartz restored the original Neue Haas Grotesk in digital form – bringing back features like optical size variations, alternate glyphs, and refined spacing – and captured much of the warmth and personality of the original.

Neue Haas Grotesk is the most widely used font on the MIT Technology Review website. It's used for body text, metadata, story lists and streams, comments, and other widgets.

### Miller

Miller, designed by Matthew Carter in 1997, is a “Scotch Roman,” a class of sturdy, general purpose types of Scottish
origin, widely used in the United States in the 19th century. 

Miller is faithful to the Scotch style though not to any one historical example — and is authentic in having both roman and italic
small caps, a feature of the originals.

On our website, we use Miller almost exclusively for headlines on article pages.

### Benton Sans

Benton Sans is a typeface that is the result of Tobias Frere-Jones efforts to study and redesign News Gothic in 1995, which was later expanded by Cyrus Highsmith. 

Benton Sans is used mostly for utility and navigation purposes.

#### Links

## Images

There are a few different ways we place images in stories. 

#### Thumbnails

A story's thumbnail is used in a variety of places across the website including stream pages, various sections of the home page, and related content boxes. To ensure consistency in layout, the dimensions of the thumbnails are always square. We size our thumbnails to be 392 x 392 pixels so that if that image is selected as the A1 story, it will be large enough for the A1 on the home page.

### Example of a thumbnail at different sizes throughout the website

#### Images in stories

Articles can support images as wide as 519px. If an image is 299px in width or less, it hangs into the margin with the caption tucked underneath it. 

### Small image that is 299px wide

![Example: Small image in a story](/img/elements-images-4.jpg)

When an image is 300px wide or more, it will be displayed in alignment with the body text. Larger images should be no wider than 519px. 

### Large image that is 519px wide

## Buttons

### Primary 

This style should be used for primary calls to action that initiate some kind of transaction, such as "Buy Now" or "Activate Account".

![Example: Primary button](/img/elements-buttons-1.jpg)

### Secondary 

These smaller buttons are for secondary actions and functions, such as pagination, 

![Example: Secondary button](/img/elements-buttons-2.jpg)

### Tertiary 

These text links are for actions used to navigate the website. There may be several of these buttons present on a single page.
